I am a Ph.D. candidate, fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jungseul Ok](https://sites.google.com/view/jungseulok).
I aim to make AI robots more accessible to a wider range of people and tasks.
Towards this goal, my research focuses on embodied AI and reinforcement learning, with a particular interest in developing robust and cost-efficient algorithms for decision-making.

Previously, I completed my B.S.E. in [Computer Science and Engineering at POSTECH](https://ecse.postech.ac.kr).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
